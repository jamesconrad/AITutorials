# AITutorials
A collection of AI tutorials from university.

In each weeks tutorial we were tasked with creating an AI to accomplish a task. We were limited to an hour and a half for each tutorial.

To build and run, run dependencies.bat then regenerate_projects.bat and look for the "bin/INFR 4320U.sln" file.
